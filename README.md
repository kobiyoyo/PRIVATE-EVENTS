# PRIVATE-EVENTS

This project is aimed at building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
